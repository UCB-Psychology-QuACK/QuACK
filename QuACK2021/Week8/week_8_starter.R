# 1. Write a for loop to save all even numbers between 1 and 10. Save the result in a new vector called even.



# 2. Look at the function rnorm() in the Help window (you can use ?rnorm()) or google it. What does rnorm do?

#### We can simulate the data collection process in R ####

# Define our random variable with a function



# Plot our observations


# The exact values change but the definition of heights is consistent. 

# In practice we don't want the values to change each time. To keep our results consistent, we want to simulate random data collection ONCE.

set.seed(342)


# This lets us reproduce the same sequence of random numbers every time we run the analysis. 
# Try changing the seed and see what happens.
