################### Warm up #########################

#1.a. Create a vector called guest_list that contains the names "Willa", "Roya", "Elena"


#1.b. Access the third element in the vector guest_list


# 2a. Create a vector called phone_no that contains three phone numbers: (3459430876, 2067389942, 5482240381)


# 2b. Access the third phone number in the list. 


# 3a. The function paste0() allows you to concatenate elements into one string. Try the following code to test it out: 
week_days = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

paste0("Today is ",  week_days[2])

# 3b. Now use the paste0 function along with your answers to 1b and 2b to print the following message: 
# "Elena's phone number is 5482240381." 



################### For Loops #######################
## We can use indexing to get elements of a vector. 

guest_list = c("Willa", "Roya", "Elena")

guest_list[1]
guest_list[2]
guest_list[3]

## For loops build on this idea but allow us to iterate over the elements. 

for (i in 1:3)(
  print(guest_list[i])
)

## For loops allow us to do more than access a vector
# Let's use the power of the loop to personalize our message. 
# Change the for loop to print " Hi <guest name> Iâ€™m having a Halloween Party on 10/31! The party starts at 9pm. I hope to see you there!

for (i in 1:length(guest_list))(
  

  
)

  


## Indexing allows us to access information from multiple vectors in the same loop. 

# lets include phone number at the top of our message

for (i in 1:3)(

 
  
)

## Lets save our custom messages in a new vector "sent"
sent <- c()

for (i in 1:3)(
  
  
)
