##### Instructions ####

# Use for loops to answer the following questions!



#### Question 1 ####
# Print the following pattern
# 1 
# 1 2 
# 1 2 3 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 1 2 3 4 5





#### Question 2 ####
# Make the multiplication table for a given number (table should be 1 through
# 10), and save it into a vector named mult_tbl
# For example, start with the multiplication table for the number 2
# (After running your code, mult_tbl should be c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20))






#### Question 3 ####
# For a given number, calculate the sum of all the numbers between 1 and the given number. Print out the running total after you add the next number.
# Hint: How will you store the running sum?





#### Question 4: Introduction to "nested" for loops ####
# Run the following code

for(outerLoop_index in 1:4) {
  for(innerLoop_index in 1:5) {
    print(paste0("Outter loop index = ", outerLoop_index, " and inner loop index = ", innerLoop_index))
  }
}

# What is happening in the code? Describe any patterns you see.



#### Bonus: Question 5 ####

# 1) Print the lyrics to the song "The Hokey Pokey"!
# Sample lyrics: 
# Put your left foot in
# You take your left foot out
# You put your left foot in
# And you shake it all about
# You do the hokey pokey
# And turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about!

# ... and right foot, and head, and left hand, and right hand, and tongue!
