## Programming and Data Skills Bootcamp
### Welcome to UC Berkeley Psychology Department's summer bootcamp! 
This hands-on four session bootcamp will focus on teaching fundemental data skills in R with an emphasis on good data and coding practicies. This bootcamp is open to all RAs and post-bacs in the department. Graduate students are also welcome to attend.

### Instructors
The bootcamp is developed and taught by [Elena Leib](https://bungelab.berkeley.edu/graduate-students/) and [Willa Voorhies](https://cnl.berkeley.edu/people/willa-voorhies/), who are 4th year PhD students in the department.

### Core Goals
1) Provide hands-on training in fundamental programming and data skills with real data.  

2) Build an inclusive, supportive and positive space for learning and teaching quantitative skills in the community. 

### Schedule

We will meet virtually for 1.5 hours weekly on Tuesdays, in July from 12-1:30pm PST. 

Each session will start with a live demo focusing on fundemental data skills. We will then work independently and in groups to apply these skills to real data. Finally we will finish each session with a group discussion centering around challenges you faced working with the data and ways to address and overcome these challenges.

### Materials guide
We are committed to open science and we make all of our resources and teaching materials freely available for offline learning.

**Data**: We will be using the same dataset throughout the bootcamp. You can find the data in the session 1 practice materials.   

Each week we will post some additional materials: 

* **Practice materials**: This will include any starter code and prompts for the independent and/or group work. The best way to learn to program is to practice! So if you are participating asynchronously, we encourage you to try the practice work on your own and use [piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kqgzwi37jc6c) to share any comments or ask questions you might have! 
* **Live demo script**: Each session will begin with a demo where we introduce some fundemental skills and key concepts that will help you with the practice materials. We will post these after each session. This will also include answer keys for the group activity if applicable. 
* **Slides**: Any slides used will be made available for download after the session. 
* **Recording**: We will be recording all of our sessions. If you miss a session we encourage you to watch the recording! 

### Participating Live
Please download the practice materials **before each session**. We will be sharing all other materials after the session.
See our [FAQs](https://ucb-psychology-quack.github.io/site/summer_bootcamp/FAQs) for more info on the workshop and what to do if you miss a session. 

### Participating asynchronously 
Each week we will post a recording of the session as well as all of the materials you need to follow along. See the [materials guide](https://github.com/UCB-Psychology-QuACK/site/blob/main/summer_bootcamp/bootcamp.md#materials-guide) for more details. Additionally, we recommend joining our [piazza page](https://piazza.com/class/kqgzwi37jc6c) to continue the conversation between sessions and after the bootcamp has ended!
