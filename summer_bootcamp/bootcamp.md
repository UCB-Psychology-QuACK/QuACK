# Summer Bootcamp
This is a four-session programming and data skills bootcamp in July 2021. we will focus on teaching key skills in R for data organization and visualization aimed at the level of RAs and post-bacs (graduate students are also welcome). Each week will consist of a short lesson and demonstration followed by hands-on practice in small groups with a real dataset. Throughout the workshop we will facilitate discussions around reproducible research and transparent data practices. 

**Core Goals:** 1) Provide hands-on training in fundamental programming and data skills with real data and 2) Build an inclusive, supportive and positive space for learning and teaching quantitative skills in the community.
