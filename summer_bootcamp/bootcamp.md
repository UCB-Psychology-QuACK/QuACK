## Programming and Data Skills Bootcamp
#### Welcome to the Psychology Department's summer bootcamp! 
This hands-on four session bootcamp will focus on teaching fundemental data skills in R with an emphasis on good data and coding practicies. This bootcamp is open to all RAs and post-bacs in the department (Graduate students are also welcome).

#### Core Goals:
1) Provide hands-on training in fundamental programming and data skills with real data.  

2) Build an inclusive, supportive and positive space for learning and teaching quantitative skills in the community. 

### Schedule

We will meet virtually for 1.5 hours weekly on Tuesdays, in July from 12-1:30pm PST. 

Each session will start with a live demo focusing on fundemental data skills. We will then work independently and in groups to apply these skills to real data. Finally we will finish each session with a group discussion centering around challenges you faced working with the data and ways to address and overcome these challenges.
