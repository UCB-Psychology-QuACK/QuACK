# Summer Bootcamp
This is a four-session programming and data skills bootcamp in July 2021. We will focus on teaching key skills in R for data organization and visualization. 

**Core Goals:** 
1) Provide hands-on training in fundamental programming and data skills with real data.
2) Build an inclusive, supportive and positive space for learning and teaching quantitative skills in the community. 

This bootcamp is open to all RAs and post-bacs in the department. Graduate students are also welcome. 
### Open science and accessibility
We are committed to open science and we make all of our resources and teaching materials freely available. We will be posting all the videos and practice exercises from each session below. Additionally we recommend joining our [piazza page](piazza.com/berkeley/summer2021/psychbootcamp) to continue the conversation between sessions and after the bootcamp has ended!  

See our [FAQs](https://ucb-psychology-quack.github.io/site/summer_bootcamp/FAQs) for more info on participating asynchronously.

### Weekly schedule

We will meet virtually for 1.5 hours weekly on Tuesday in July from 12-1:30pm PST. 
Each session will start with a live demo focusing on fundemental data skills. Participants will then work together in small groups to apply these skills to real world data. Finally we will finish each session with a group discussion centering around challenges you faced working with the data and ways to address and overcome these challenges
