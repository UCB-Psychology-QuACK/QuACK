# Summer Bootcamp
This is a four-session programming and data skills bootcamp in July 2021. This bootcamp is open to all RAs, post-bacs, and lab managers in the Berkeley Psychology department. Graduate students are also welcome to attend. The bootcamp will focus on teaching key skills in R for data organization and visualization aimed at the level of RAs and post-bacs. Each week will consist of a short lesson and demonstration followed by hands-on practice in small groups with a real dataset. Throughout the workshop we will facilitate discussions around reproducible research and transparent data practices. 

**Core Goals:** 1) Provide hands-on training in fundamental programming and data skills with real data and 2) Build an inclusive, supportive and positive space for learning and teaching quantitative skills in the community.

Bootcamp participants will learn fundemental skills for working with data in R and then  work together in small groups to apply these skills to real world data. We will finish each session with a group discussion centering around challenges you faced working with the data and ways to address and overcome these challenges.
